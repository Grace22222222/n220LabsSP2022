let shapeD = document.getElementById("shape");

//Had an issue with placement of the styles below

shape.style.height="100px";
shape.style.width="100px";
shape.style.backgroundColor="#00FF66";

//Spent some time trying to figure out how to make the sizing change
//varName+"px"

    var height = "100px";
    var width = "100px";
