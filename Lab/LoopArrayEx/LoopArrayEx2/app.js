//Beep Bop

//INSTRUCTIONS Cuz this one sounds difficult 
//Write a loop that runs 25 times and writes the iterand (current iteration of the loop) out onto the page inside of a div element.However, When the iterand is divisible by 3, write the word "beep" instead/ When the iterand is divisible by 5, write the word "bop" instead/ When the iterand is divisible by 3 AND 5, write "beepbop" instead/

let robit = document.getElementById("Robot");

for(let i=0;i<26;i++){

    robit.innerHTML+= i + "&nbsp;";

}

if (variable=4) {
